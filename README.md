# Enledger-Notary
A suite for notarizing any type of data onto the EnLedger Notary Blockchain & Data Server Network

EnLedgerize! your data using the EnLedger-Notary toolset for secure data storage and heirarchically permissioned data access.

EnLedger-Notary project is a blockchain node implementation and set of tools for securely storing any type of data with
permissioned access layers. Secure or encrypted data can be notarized, with full protocol for authentication layers and
efficient encrypted data access by any number of key-holders. EnLedger-Notary is based on the Tendermint Message Server
Protocol and uses a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus protocol to add to verfify new blocks in a blockchain.

EnLedger-Notary Blockchain Node &amp; Data Server platform is built on a model that includes a
distributed hash table (DHT) data-storage mechanism alongside the blockchain nodes.
We recommend a model with a data-efficient, two-keyholder data encryption scheme for privata data, and provide tools for
allowing any outside user to request data access from one or both keyholders. Enledger-Notary can also support encryption schemes
with n keyholders.
